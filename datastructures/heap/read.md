# Heap
A Heap is a complete binary tree data structure that satisfies the heap property: 
    - for every node, the value of its children is greater than or equal to its own value
    - allowing quick access to the maximum or minimum element, depending on the type of heap

# Types of Heaps
- Min Heap: the value of child nodes is greater than or equal to the value of its parent. The root node has the minimum value.
- Max Heap: the value of child nodes is smaller than or equal to the value of its parent. The root node has the maximum value.
    
# Application
Heaps are usually used to implement priority queues, where the smallest (or largest) element is always at the root of the tree.
